Project 1

This is a group project. You should work in groups of 2 to 4 (not alone and not more than 4). If this is a problem, please let me know ahead of time.


For simplicity, I will use the term script to describe the project. But you can have multiple scripts or one or more Jupyter Notebooks.


The following are required elements of the final script that is turned in:

The script should read/get information one of the following (you can use multiple, but do not need to):
A file
A web service (API)
A web page


The script should have at least one of each of the following flow control elements:
for or while loop
if statement
You must define and use at least two functions
You must import at least one module (e.g., os, re, argparse, numpy, pandas, etc.)
You must write something to a file
Links to an external site.What to do
You may choose one of the following for what your script does as long as it meets the above criteria.


Write a script to analyze the flight data from Problem Set 2. You can choose what you want to analyze or ask for help if you can't think of anything.
Write a script to query an API and display/save results you find interesting. In the Web Services class, I pointed out this list of public APIsLinks to an external site.; there are others.
If you have an idea, I can try to help find a data source and API.
Write a script that does anything of your choice. This is kind of wide open, but remember the criteria above. Each of those criteria must be satisfied in your script for total points.
